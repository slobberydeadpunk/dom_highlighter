# DOM Highlighter

Preview any public web page inside a sandboxed iframe, visually inspect its DOM, and capture an ordered set of annotated highlights you can export, re-import, and replay later.

## Features

- **Live preview** – fetches the remote HTML server-side, rewrites it with a permissive base and injected scripts, then renders it in an iframe.
- **Interactive highlighting** – hover to see a flashing outline; click to lock a highlight; double-click to remove a lock; `Esc` clears all locks.
- **Inline annotations** – type notes for each locked element in the sidebar; annotations appear as floating callouts beside their elements only when content is present.
- **Replay & persistence** – export the current highlight sequence as JSON, import it back, or replay the sequence to restore highlights in order (helpful for walkthroughs or reviews).
- **Resilient injection** – automatically restores injected assets if the remote page attempts to remove them and keeps annotations positioned on scroll/resize.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (Node 22 LTS recommended)

### Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server starts on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **Note:** The app fetches target pages from this server. If you run behind a reverse proxy, ensure `X-Forwarded-Proto` is set so asset URLs resolve correctly.

## Using the App

1. Enter a URL in the top-left field (include `https://` for best results) and press **Preview**.
2. Hover elements in the preview to see outlines; **click** to lock a highlight. Locked elements appear in the **Highlights** list.
3. Add annotations by typing in the textarea for each highlight. The note bubble is only rendered when the annotation has content.
4. **Double-click** a highlighted element in the preview (or press **Remove** in the list) to clear that highlight. Press **Esc** to remove all.
5. Use the sidebar actions:
   - **Highlight**: reapply the selector immediately.
   - **Replay**: step through all saved highlights in order (clears existing locks first).
   - **Export JSON**: download the ordered highlight data.
   - **Import**: load a previously exported JSON file and optionally replay it.

### Keyboard / Pointer Summary

- Hover → temporary outline
- Click → toggle lock on the hovered element
- Double-click → remove the locked highlight
- `Esc` → clear all locked highlights

## JSON Format

Exports produce a file shaped like:

```json
{
  "generatedAt": "2024-11-30T10:45:00.123Z",
  "highlights": [
    {
      "order": 1,
      "selector": "#hero h1",
      "description": "h1#hero-title (512×96)",
      "annotation": "Primary headline"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `selector` is the CSS path used during replay (best-effort, based on tag/id/class/nth-of-type).
- `annotation` holds the user-supplied note (empty strings are ignored by the overlay).
- When importing, you can provide an array of highlights directly or wrap them in the object shown above.

## Limitations & Tips

- **CORS / mixed content**: Remote pages fetched over HTTPS may still reference insecure assets or run scripts that try cross-origin XHR. These are surfaced as console warnings/errors inside the iframe but do not block highlighting.
- **Dynamic pages**: Sites that aggressively mutate the DOM may remove locks. The injector re-applies styles and removes entries whose elements disappear.
- **Selectors**: Replaying imported highlights depends on selectors still matching. If markup changes, entries will be marked “Element not found.” You can update the annotation to document the gap or delete the highlight.
- **Security**: The tool renders remote HTML directly. Avoid pointing it at untrusted internal sites unless you trust their scripts inside your browser sandbox.

## Development Notes

- Express 5 is used with native `fetch`. No client build step—static assets are plain HTML/CSS/JS.
- The server strips `<meta http-equiv="content-security-policy">` tags to ensure the injected scripts run.
- Highlight annotations are exchanged with the parent via `postMessage`. Only messages flagged with `__domHighlighter` are processed.
